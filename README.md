# Binary Addition
Binary addition is similar to regular addision but instead of using the digits 0 through 9, it only uses 0 and 1 to add. It is like if you were to count with just two fingers. Here are the simple rules to follow:
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10 ---> this is where 1 plus 1 equals 2, but since we only hve 0s and 1s, we write it as "10", meaning 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.

I's just like how in regular addition, sometimes you carry over a number when the total is more than 9.
