# Binary Addition
Binary addition is similar to regular addision but instead of using the digits 0 through 9, it only uses 0 and 1 to add. It is like if you were to count with just two fingers. Here are the simple rules to follow:
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10 ---> this is where 1 plus 1 equals 2, but since we only hve 0s and 1s, we write it as "10", meaning 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.

I's just like how in regular addition, sometimes you carry over a number when the total is more than 9.

# Half Adders

A half adder is a simple machine used in computers to help them add two small numbers together, just like when you add numbers in math class. But instead of adding big numbers, a half adder only adds two tiny numbers, either 0 or 1.

How it works:

If both numbers are 0, the sum is 0, and there’s no carry.

If one number is 0 and the other is 1, the sum is 1, and still no carry.

If one number is 1 and the other is 0, the sum is 1, and still no carry.

If both numbers are 1, the sum is 0, but now there’s a carry of 1 because the total becomes 2 which is too big to fit in one place, so the extra goes to the carry.

The half adder we talked about is like a tiny piece of the puzzle inside a machine like this. Just as gears turn to calculate numbers in the difference engine, the half adder handles small steps of adding 0s and 1s inside modern computers. Computers today may be much smaller, but they still rely on simple operations like the ones done by these early machines!
